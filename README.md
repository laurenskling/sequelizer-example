# sequelizer-example
I created this repo to document my experience trying out GraphQL. 
In this episode, i read the data from SQL using Sequelize.
Maybe it is of some help to someone.

## run
`npm start` will create some testdata and start the server on localhost:3000. Vist localhost:3000/data to use Graphiql and explore.
